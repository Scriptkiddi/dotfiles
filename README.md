dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles, committed for everybody (and me).

Feel free to use them as template for your own dotfiles, but remember: _Those are my dotfiles. Be creative yourself. You don't want my crap, you want your own._

##Installation
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/dasJ/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
	~/.dotfiles/install.sh
	And remember to press enter for vim while installing. I may fix this one day.
